# Task-2
I just finished building a simple yet functional stopwatch application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 
It's a great beginner project to learn the basics of web development while creating something interactive.
Features:
Start/Pause functionality 
Reset to restart the timer 
Lap functionality to record elapsed time between laps 🏃‍♂
Stylish design with responsive layout 
Clean and easy-to-understand code structure
